# The Developer's Toolbelt

???

We are going to be throwing a lot at you. Some of it in more depth than others
but the goal is to give you exposure to these tools and explain why they are
useful, not to teach them in depth

---

# Overview

<i class="fas fa-code" style="color: teal; float: right; font-size:4em"></i>
* Editors & IDEs
    * CLI text editors
    * Graphical text editors
    * Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

## Lets change some file contents

---

# <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Terminal Editors
---
class: middle

* Run inside of a terminal (obviously)
* Are generally shipped with all *nix systems
* Incredibly lightweight
* Pretty bare-bones by default, but can be very powerful when understood and customised
* May have steep learning curves

## Why?

* Great for quickly editing a file when you're already in a terminal
* Can be incorporated into scripts if needs be

<h2>Vim</h2>

???

Don't let the simple-looking interfaces fool you, these can be incredibly powerful
editors if you spend the time learn and customise them.

They aren't really for beginners because they have steep learning curves, but
they are worth looking at in the future.

They are great for quickly opening a file to do a simple edit without having to
leave the terminal and load a more bulky program.

### Just remember one thing for now

<img src="http://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/December2017/quit-vim.png" style="float:right; width: 50%"/>

## Vim - `:qa!`

## Nano = `Ctrl-x` then '`n`'

???

There is often a joke about not being able to quit vim

And you may accidentally find your self in vim when using other tools,
because they assume that's the editor you want to use

# <i class="fas fa-code"></i> GUI Text Editors
---

class: middle

* Simple WYSIWYG interface (Buttons, menus and the usual shortcuts)
* May have more flashy defaults than terminal emulator (syntax highlighting, auto-complete)

## Why?

* Great for edit configuration scripts or simple programming tasks
* Lightweight so you can have loads of them open
---

- Sublime Text
- Emacs
- VSCode

---
layout: true
## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
---

* Lots of features that help in large programming tasks
    * Lots of introspection into the programming language for auto-completion, code analysis and code generation
    * Can run from inside the program
    * Debugger (more on that later)
* Often very heavyweight (can't run too many instance at once!)
* Usually specific to a single programming language
* Double-edged sword as there is a lot of abstraction but overall useful for beginners

## Why?

* If you are using a specific language you will possibly be more productive with an IDE
* If you are learning how to program

# Productivity

---

# Productivity

* Communication and Collaboration
    * IRC and mailing lists (seriously)
    * Slack, Gitter
    * Google Hangouts, appear.in, Slack calls
    * Office suite: Google Drive, LibreOffice (MS Office bad)
    * Code hosting sites: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket

???

Email is federated, distributed, flexible, works well for them

--

* Project Management
    * Work: Jira, Trello
    * Knowledge sharing: Confluence, MediaWiki, GitHub Wiki
    * Make diagrams: lucidchart.com, draw.io

---

## IDE Debuggers

Completely interactive and GUI-driven (most of them)

Pause and resume program execution at any point

Follow code execution line by line

Inspect variables while the application is running
